# Defect_Scripts

This repository contains the configurations and scripts that I used to simulation and characterize liquid crystal defects, published at Nature Communications. I employed molecular dynamics simulations and home made analatical tools to generate and characterize the defects.  

### Install

This project requires **Namd** for molecular dynamics simulations and **Python 2.7** for running analysis scripts. 

- [Namd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org/)


I recommend install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains most of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
